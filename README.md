Clustering Using Genetic Algorithm


Genetic algorithms are a type of evolutionary algorithm that are inspired by the concept of natural selection. These algorithms use biologically inspired operators like mutation, crossover, and selection to find optimal solutions to optimization and search problems. Examples of genetic algorithm applications include solving sudoku puzzles, hyperparameter optimization, and improving decision tree performance. On the other hand, machine learning is an algorithm that learns patterns from historical data and predicts future outcomes. This project aims to investigate whether genetic algorithms can be used to learn patterns from data, which may seem impossible at first but is actually possible. There are two types of approaches to machine learning: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The training data in supervised machine learning is already labeled, meaning each occurrence of data has a matching output. In contrast, the data in unsupervised machine learning is unlabeled. Clustering is an unsupervised learning problem where each data instance must be assigned the best label.
