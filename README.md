A genetic algorithm is a type of evolutionary algorithm that draws its inspiration from the idea of natural selection. Genetic algorithms frequently employ biologically inspired operators including mutation, crossover, and selection to produce high-quality solutions to optimization and search issues. Solving sudoku puzzles, hyperparameter optimization, and decision tree performance improvement are a few examples of GA applications. Whereas, Machine learning is the type of algorithm that learns the patterns from historical data and predict future outcomes. This project helps in understanding if the genetic algorithm can be used to learn patterns from the data. This sounds impossible at first but is actually possible. In Machine learning, there are 2 types of approaches which are Supervised learning and Unsupervised Learning.The training data in supervised machine learning is already labeled, so each occurrence of the data has a matching output (s). The data in unsupervised machine learning is labelless. Clustering is an unsupervised learning problem in which each data instance must have the best label assigned to it.
